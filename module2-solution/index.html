<h1>Module 2 Coding Assignment</h1>

<div class="row">
  <h2>Desktop Instructions</h2>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  	<p>In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower. (Hint: use percentages to define width and use the ‘float’ property. See Lecture 24). For a visual reference of this view, see the desktop mockup illustration below.
  	</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Tablet Instructions</h2>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  	<p>In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively), the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the tablet mockup illustration below.

  </div>

  <h2>Mobile Instructions</h2>
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
  	<p>In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.
